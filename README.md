# 3D Interactive Sphere with Three.js and GSAP

## Description

This project is a visually engaging 3D web experience created using Three.js and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). It features an interactive 3D sphere that changes its color based on user interaction. The application showcases the capabilities of WebGL for rendering 3D graphics in web browsers.

## Features

-   **3D Sphere**: A dynamically rendered sphere demonstrating 3D capabilities.
-   **Interactive Lighting**: A point light that enhances the sphere's visual appeal.
-   **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts dynamically to fit the window size.
-   **User Interaction**: Sphere color changes according to cursor position when the mouse is pressed.
-   **Fluid Animations**: Smooth animations powered by GSAP.
